# Kiraproto
 threejs implementation of Kira's proto to demonstrate soft shadows
Might be a bit advanced if you're just starting with 3D concepts, but I tried to comment and be readable
Everything concerning shadows is tagged "!SHADOW!" in the code for easy lookup
 
 Also contains many things useful in genart:
 - Example of fxhash integration with Liam Egan wrapper  https://github.com/liamegan/fxhash-helpers
 - Container / resize / aspect ratio handling
 - Custom mesh generation
 - Scene optimization techniques, with merging and instancing
 - Example glsl injection by extending three.js materials
 - Seeded random texture generation to feed shaders

Based on the official fxhash webpack boilerplate project https://github.com/fxhash/fxhash-webpack-boilerplate
